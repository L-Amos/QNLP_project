    "I have a meeting with my supervisor tomorrow, the first one since starting work on this project. As a result, a lot of things have happened; it is sensible, I think, to go through everything I've done so far and explain my reasoning for each step, to ensure it is well-organised in my mind before I speak to her about it. I will also go through what problems I currently face, and a rough roadmap for where I see this project going. Note: I have decided to write this in a Jupyter notebook, as it allows me to more explicitly talk through what code I have done."
