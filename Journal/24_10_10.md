# Day 3: 10th October 2024
## Entry 1: 11:55
Today will be largely a continuation of yesterday, since I had to leave for a social event. Now that I have a trained model, I can start playing with it, feeding it new sentences to see how it copes. Specifically I want to implement the fidelity test to ensure things work as I expect.

I have a specific rough test in mind, as an indicator more than anything. I will take the sentences from the training and dev data and alter them slightly, by perhaps changing pronouns or adjectives. I will then measure the fidelity of the altered sentence compared to the original sentence, to see how close they are. It's not a rigorous test, but it'll be a good proof-of-concept; if the fidelity is extremely low, then it is doubtful whether I can simply bolt on a QKNN algorithm - I may have to change the ansatz or the method of training the model.

## Entry 2: 13:27
I have realised that I cannot simply use a lambeq model for what I want to do. When fed a PQC, the model outputs the estimate of the resulant qubit state if parsed through the optimized quantum circuit. Unfortunately, there is no way of actually obtaining this quantum circuit. Therefore, in order to implement my algorithm I will have to dig deeper into the training process of the pipeline, manually running it and extracting the quantum circuits.
