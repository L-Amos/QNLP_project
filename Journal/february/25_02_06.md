## Entry 1: 10:12
I've been making good progress on this report, but as I think of new features and try new approaches my GitHub repo becomes messy and complicated. As a result, my first order of business today is to **clean up the repo**, making it easier to navigate and removing any unnecessary files.

Next, I want to look into cost functions, ensuring I am using the best one available (or at the very least, being in a position to write down why the one I'm using is good). 

Next, I want to rigorously identify a step-by-step **experimental procedure** for training models. I then want to integrate this into a **well-managed training library** with a CLI so that I can use the command line to run any model training I want, with automatic saving of outputs. This should also handle any error cases (such as the strange 'Permission Denied' error I've been seeing when the model tries to save a training checkpoint). Ideally, this library should save a log of errors so that I know exactly what has happened.

Once this is done, I should be in a very good position to further play with hyperparameters and training data, eventually being able to move on to the next part of the project: classical KNN for binary classification.
