# Day 7: 24th October 2024
## Entry 1: 13:38
Today I will be following on from [yesterday](./23_10_24.md) and implementing the NDCG calculation to quantifiably evaluate the accuracy of my quantum pipeline. I may need to optimize my code to make it run a little faster, so I may utilize cuda to parallelize the workload.
## Entry 2: 17:41
Managed to get somewhere; running the calculations across all test sentences gives an average NDCG of 0.84ish when compared to the BERT model. This is largely meaningless at the moment, as I require some guidance from my supervisor on how exactly to score each item in the array. However, it shows that the method works. 

The only problem is that **it takes forever to run** (around 30 mins). I can't use numba or cuda to speed it up because lambeq is too exotic for that. Any optimizations must be done at algorithm-level. Hopefully I'll have a brainwave, because waiting for 30 minutes to evaluate my fidelity tester is going to be very annoying.
