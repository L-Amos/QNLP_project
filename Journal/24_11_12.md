# Day 10: 12th November 2024
## Entry 1: 09:19
This week I have been swamped by deadlines, but I have managed to carve out today to do some solid work on this project. I have several goals in mind for today:

- Sort out the file structure of my repo.
- Write a function to determine the accuracy of my model.
- Rather than randomly generating train, test and validation data, specify the generation to generate **good** data, constituted by the following parameters:
    - 50% of pairs having sentences of the same topic and 50% of different topics
    - Every word in the vocabulary used at least three times
    - A good range in SBERT cosine similarity
- Once this data is generated, conduct my first **real and rigorous** investigation into model training, plotting convergences for different hyperparameters.
- Conduct a similar investigation with the default binary classification model, and compare the two models' convergence (hopefully my model will be much better).
- For the above two investigations to be feasible, I may need to add a flag to use a simpler simulator rather than thr Aer simulator.
- Time allowing, place these Journal pages into a Sphinx-created website + host on GitHub pages.

As you can see, I have a lot to be getting on with, so I better get cracking!
