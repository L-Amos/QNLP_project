After a break to catch up on coursework and write my project outline, I am *back*. There is one word to describe today's task: **optimization**. Training takes far too long for my testing purposes; I need to find a way to speed things up so that I can make adjustments as I go and immediately see their effect, rather than waiting for 15 minutes between small code changes.

I will look into a variety of different methods for this, including trying to simplify the model, trying JIT compilation and possibly using PennyLane instead of Qiskit to see if it is any faster.
