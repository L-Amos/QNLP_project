# Day 3: 10th October 2024
## Entry 1: 11:55
Today will be largely a continuation of yesterday, since I had to leave for a social event. Now that I have a trained model, I can start playing with it, feeding it new sentences to see how it copes. Specifically I want to implement the fidelity test to ensure things work as I expect.

I have a specific rough test in mind, as an indicator more than anything. I will take the sentences from the training and dev data and alter them slightly, by perhaps changing pronouns or adjectives. I will then measure the fidelity of the altered sentence compared to the original sentence, to see how close they are. It's not a rigorous test, but it'll be a good proof-of-concept; if the fidelity is extremely low, then it is doubtful whether I can simply bolt on a QKNN algorithm - I may have to change the ansatz or the method of training the model.
