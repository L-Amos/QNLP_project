## Entry 1: 09:19
It's been a frustratingly-long time since I have had a chance to work on this project, so for the next few days I am totally committed. 

As the number of approaches I try inflates, and the number of changes I make to the program grows, I need to keep my current workflows in my mind both to enable me to write a thesis effectively and to ensure I have good reasoning for taking the steps I am. Therefore, today I will explicitly write out my current approach in its entirety, as this will solidify my reasoning in my mind and expose any hand-waving I am currently doing. In particular, I wish to revisit these core parts of my project:
- Research ansatze + provide reasoning for why I have chosen the one I have chosen
- Same as above for optimisers
- Same as above for cost functions
- Identify a way of comparing trained models to tune hyperparameters
