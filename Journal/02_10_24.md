Yesterday Professor Sadrzadeh and I agreed on a title for this master's project: **Combining Statistical and Structured Quantum Methods in NLP**. I am excited to make a start.

Today I will be running some initial tests with lambeq. As I have never used this package before (and until last week had never heard of it) I need to play around with it to understand how it works, and how I can use it in my project.

I plan to parse some rudimentary sentences to understand how lambeq translates them into quantum circuits. I plan on parsing three sentences:

- Bob hates Alice
- Alice does not hate Bob
- Alice likes Chris

These sentences are quite good starting points, as they are all related to each other in some way. It will give me an idea of how related sentences are translated into quantum circuits - if the circuits are totally different from one another, the machine learning using the $k$ nearest neighbours algorithm will be difficult.

I plan on parsing these sentences in different orders with each test, to see if the order changes the circuits produced. I believe this will be the case, as from my reading the circuits are initially created using *ans√§tze*, and then subsequent circuits are refined using the initial circuit produced (provided the succeeding sentences relate to the initial sentence parsed).
