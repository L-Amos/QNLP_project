# Day 4: 17th October 2024
## Entry 1: 03:28
Please excuse the early hour, but I couldn't sleep and it seemed like a good idea to get cracking with this week's project work. 

I have managed to organise my thoughts regarding the use of QKNN with lambeq. I thought that I would need to have access to the quantum circuits with optimum parameters found by the model in order to compare qubit state fidelity. However, this is not necessarily the case, as I can simply store the states returned by the model classically, and then re-encode them onto qubits before using the QKNN algorithm. However, there is an issue which I found when playing with my [state fidelity circuit](../testing/state_fidelity_with_model.ipynb): the training phase of the lambeq pipeline includes post-selection, which means the returned qubit states are **sub-normalized**. This means they cannot be re-encoded onto qubits.

Today's job is to use a [2022 Oxford PhD thesis](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/aleks.kissinger/theses/khatri-thesis.pdf) to find an approach to work around the sub-normalization in a way which allows for my state fidelity circuit to be implemented. Failing that, I could form a theoretical framework for using [NV sensors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00964-z) to measure the qubits in the training phase in a single-shot, removing the need for post-selection. However, since current quantum computers do not use NV sensors, this would not be experimentally verifiable, and would require lots of work to simulate. It may be an interesting extension to the project regardless.
