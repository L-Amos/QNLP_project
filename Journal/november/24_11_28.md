# Day 12: 28th November 2024
## Entry 1: 08:56
Yesterday I spent the day training my model with various different hyperparameters to get a feel for how well the model is converging. Each run of 120 epochs takes about half an hour. This is obviously far slower than I would like.

Therefore today I will put in an entire day's work to try and build my fidelity model onto lambeq's NumpyModel, rather than its QuantumModel. Since the NumpyModel uses JIT-compiled code, it should be much faster, potentially as much as an order of magnitude. Unfortunately, unlike the Aer simulator it is not shot-based, and so I will have to find another way of performing post-selection. I'm hoping my work on the `noiseless_simulation` branch will help with this.
