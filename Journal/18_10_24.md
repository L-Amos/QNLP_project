## Entry 1: 13.13
After a much-needed sleep I am back on it today. I have already [created a new notebook](../testing/testing_model.ipynb) which tests the accuracy of the model given test data. The accuracy was something like 87%, which should be fine for my purposes.

So what's wrong with the fidelity measurements? I have had a fantastic realization; in my code I naively assumed that qubit 1 would be the sentence qubit of each circuit, but after trying a few more sentences **this is not always the case**. I therefore need to find a way of determining which qubits are the sentence qubits, and using *those* in the fidelity calculation circuit.
