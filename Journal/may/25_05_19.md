## Entry 1: 14:09
After some revision this morning, I can get back to the project. After changing the github repo layout, I'm ready to get cracking with the rest of the investigations which need to happen. First I'll investigate the effect of ansatz on training, making a record of:
- Circuit generation time
- Training time across 240 epochs
- Convergence
- Pearson correlation

This data will allow me to select the best ansatz to use out of IQP, Strongly Entangling, Sim14, Sim15 and Sim4. I know that the latest lambeq update also introduced two more ansatze; I'm too scared to update lambeq at the moment in case it breaks everything, but I might give it a go if I have time.
