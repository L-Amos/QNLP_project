## Entry 1: 09:30
Today I will be working in between revision, so I won't be able to fully focus on what I need to do. What I want to do is see if increasing the amount of train data has a noticeable effect on convergence. This need to be done before the other experiments - I don't want to spend a long time optimising parameters for 500 train pairs when a greater number of train pairs works much better.

On a positive note, I'm not sure what I was talking about in the last entry RE the correlation coefficient - the correlation is actually very good! After training it goes from near zero (as expected for randomly-initialised rotation gates) to 0.7-0.8, showing a strong positive correlation! This is very promising.
