## Entry 1: 10:47
I've already done some git tidying today: I have created tags for archived branches and deleted the branches themselves. I now have only two working branches: the main branch and the experiments branch. Overall the repository is **much** more understandable now, which is fantastic.

I have also copied across the write-up for the classical KNN experiment, using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert my latex writeup to markdown and tidying up the result. My to-do list still includes writing up the other two experiments, which I will also do in latex and convert in a similar way.

Today, though, I want to get the rest of the experiments done: comparing loss metrics and finding optimum hyperparameters (NOT just learning rate). I am prioritising this because I haven't spoken to my supervisor in a long time about this project and I want to show her the convergences for the optimum model, so she knows I am doing good work (or at least what I hope is good work).
